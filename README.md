# Algorithms for Optimization Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains supplemental Jupyter notebooks to accompany [Algorithms for Optimization](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms-optimization) by Mykel Kochenderfer and Tim Wheeler.
These notebooks were generated from the Algorithms for Optimization source code.
We provide these notebooks to aid with the development of lectures and understanding the material, with the hope that you find it useful.

## Installation
All notebooks have Julia 1.0.1 kernels.
The REQUIRE file contains the list of required Julia packages.

Rendering is managed by [PGFPlots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTeX/PGFPlots.jl).
